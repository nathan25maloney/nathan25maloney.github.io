			<p>
			My name is Nathan Maloney and the purpose of this website is to exhibit my skills and knowledge of Web Development.  I was born in the Midwest and graduated from Luther College with a Bachelors in Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science.  I started my Minor late in my college career but I absolutely loved it.  Had I known how much I enjoyed it earlier it would have been my major.  Due to my late discovery however I only had time to do one summer internship with a Web Development company.  Without additional work experience nor a portfolio of previous work I have yet to get a job in the career field I want to have my career in.  I am currently enrolled in a Web Development boot camp with the goal of adding to my resume a concrete verification that I am a qualified potential employee.  It is my mission to attain a position with a company that I can grow with somewhere in the Midwest were my wife and I can raise our family.
